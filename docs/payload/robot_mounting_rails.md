# Mounting Rails

Aluminum payload rails are located along the left and right edges of the body and provide a secure means of mounting payloads to Spot. The rails accept T-slot nuts such as Misumi HNTR5-5. Ensure that mounting screws do not project more than 6.3mm below the top surface of the mounting rail and that T-slot nuts are fully supported along each edge.


![max screw extent][rails-image1]

If precise and repeatable payload positioning is required, a single 4mm diameter pin can be added at any of six locations where the rail bolts to the robot chassis. The pin should project 5.0 +/- 0.25mm below the mounting surface of the rail and be spaced 8mm from the T-slot center-line.
