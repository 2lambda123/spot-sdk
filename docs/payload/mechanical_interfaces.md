# Mechanical Interfaces


Payloads should be designed to interface correctly with a cable connector and mount to the top of Spot. Detailed CAD can be provided upon request.


## Cable and connector interface

Boston Dynamics provides a fully shielded, over-molded DB25 cable to make the connection between Spotâ€™s payload ports and payloads. Payloads designed for the robot should have an interface for this cabling to maintain IP54 ingress protection.


### Correct orientation of DB25 relative to front of robot

### Keepout dimensions in mm

Boston Dynamics provides robust, environmentally sealed payload cables. A payload must ensure that the necessary keepout regions are compatible with the DB25 overmold on these cables.

### Sealing gland geometry in mm

Payloads should incorporate a small ridge around the DB25 connector. This ridge should be about 3mm tall and of 21mm by 63mm. Corner radius is 5mm. The ridge presses into a foam gasket on the cable side to create a seal.
