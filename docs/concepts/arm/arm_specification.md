## How big an object can the gripper grasp
The robot Arm is capable of holding any object it can fit the gripper jaws around. In general, this means that objects a person can pick up are also manageable by the robot. 
 
## Gripper safety
Continue to observe the recommended safety distance of 3 meters from the robot. Do not touch the Arm or gripper (or the robot) while the robot is active. 
 
## Pinch points
The gripper has a small clearance that offers some possibility to avoid complete pinching. However, pinching is always possible when grasping/holding objects. Limit human interaction with the gripper when in use. 
 
* Never introduce hands or fingers between an object to be grasped or being grasped and the gripper jaws. Keep hands away.
* Never attempt to open the gripper while the robot is powered on. Never try to interfere with grasping and carrying. Stay away from an active robot.
