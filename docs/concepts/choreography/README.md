# Spot Choreography SDK

Develop advanced choreographed routines for Spot. The choreography service requires a special-permissions license, as well as Python and Spot SDK.

The Choreography SDK consists of:
  * The Choreography API [protocol definitions](../../../choreography_protos/bosdyn/api/README) defines choreography moves and parameters.
  * The Choreography [python client](../../../python/bosdyn-choreography-client/src/bosdyn/choreography/client/README) communicates with Spot to upload and execute sequences on the robot.
  * The Choreographer Application is used to author choreography sequences, synchronize music, and execute routines on the robot. The application, as well as additional documentation, can be downloaded from the [Support Center](https://support.bostondynamics.com) and used with a robot that has a choreography license.

This [documentation](choreography_service.md) provides an overview of the Choreography API and Client and a description of the different choreography terms. The [Move Reference Guide](move_reference.md) provides descriptions of each choreography move and its associated parameters, as well as GIF depictions of each move.
