# Choreography moves reference

This section describes each Choreographer move at a high level, including:

* Parameters used by the move
* Animated GIFs demonstrating the move with default parameters (for most moves)

More information about the moves can be found in the [proto definitions](../../../choreography_protos/bosdyn/api/README).

## Body moves

### rotate_body

![](gif_images/image1.gif)

Rotates the body to a desired orientation.  Nominally takes one beat (4 slices) but can be extended to go slower.

Parameter | Effect
--|--
rotation | The desired body orientation.
return_to_start_pose |  If true, returns to the previous body pose by the end of this move.  If false, remains in the specified position.

### rotate_body_sharp

![](gif_images/image20.gif)

Identical to the rotate_body move, but moves to the desired position quickly and returns (unless configured not to return) more slowly.

***No Parameters***

### body_hold

![](gif_images/image4.gif)

Moves the body to a specified position/orientation and holds it steady for the specified duration then optionally returns to a neutral pose.

Parameter | Effect
--|--
rotation/translation | The desired pose.
entry_slices | How long to spend transitioning to the desired pose.
exit_slices | How quickly to transition back to the original pose.  If set to 0, remains at the specified pose.

### body_const

Holds the body at the pose from the immediately preceding body-track move.  Applies to both orientation and translation.  Can be extended to any desired duration.

***No Parameters***

### sway

![](gif_images/image15.gif)

Sway back and forth to the beat.  A full back/forth cycle takes 2 beats.

Parameter | Effect
--|--
vertical/horizontal/roll | How much motion in the respective directions.
pivot | Which portion of the body remains stationary.
style | Modifies the velocity profile of the motion.
pronounced | How exaggerated the style is.  Smaller values will be closer to the SWAY_STYLE_STANDARD.
hold_zero_axes | If set to true, maintains the previous pose in whichever axes 0 motion is specified.  If false, those axes return to nominal.

### random_rotate

![](gif_images/image7.gif)

Rotate the body in a random, chaotic manner.  Rotation in each axis is generated independently.  Can be extended to any desired duration.

Parameter | Effect
--|--
amplitude | How far from the nominal pose to rotate in each axis.
speed | How quickly to rotate in each axis.
speed_variation | How much to vary the speed.  Controls the ratio between the slowest and fastest moves.  When 0, no variation (all moves are the same speed).
num_speed_tiers | Can create multiple tiers of speed.
tier_variation | Difference between the speed of the slowest tier compared to the fastest_tier.

### twerk

![](gif_images/image9.gif)

Lowers the robutt down and back up once.  Lasts for one beat (4 slices).

Parameter | Effect
--|--

pivot | What part of the robot to pivot around.  Pivoting around the front means the robutt moves in circles.
clockwise | Which direction to rotate.

### random_stretch

Extends any extendable moves immediately prior to it by a random number of slices between 0 and the duration of the stretch move.  The robot then immediately jumps to the end of this move.  Note: This changes the duration of a choreography sequence.

Parameter | Effect
--|--
angle | The desired gripper angle.
speed | The desired velocity of the gripper in rad/s.

### frame_snapshot

This move sets the frame to be used by future moves that are in an absolute frame.  Some moves will always be in the dance frame (frame_id = 0) and some allow you to explicitly select a frame_id.  This move can set frames relative to either a fiducial or to the robot's footprint.

Parameter | Effect
--|--
