# GraphNav and Robot Locomotion

The GraphNav service provides two RPCs for navigating to different locations on the prior map:

*   NavigateTo
*   NavigateRoute

Both RPCs let the client specify maximum speed as well as the size of the goal region at the final waypoint.

## NavigateTo

The `NavigateTo` RPC is the simplest way to command a robot to go to a destination on the map once the robot is localized. GraphNav will decide which route to take, currently the one with the fewest number of edges.


## NavigateRoute

The `NavigateRoute` RPC allows the client to directly specify the path of the robot. This lets the client command the robot to take a longer path as needed. Routes are specified as a list of waypoints and edges. For example, you could make a path that doubles back on itself, allowing the robot to go to a distant waypoint and then back to the start.

Clients that maintain contact with the robot are encouraged to continuously resend the command with a deadline in the near future. This results in the robot stopping quickly if the client stops checking in. Clients that disconnect from an autonomous robot should set a longer deadline and rely on an alternate mechanism to maintain safety.

## Status and feedback

API clients should periodically query for navigation status during map replay using the `NavigationFeedback` RPC.

*   Unless an error is returned, `NavigationFeedbackResponse` is returned with status `STATUS_FOLLOWING_ROUTE` and the remaining list of waypoints and edges in the route.
*   On successful completion, the navigation status changes to `STATUS_REACHED_GOAL` when the robot reaches the end of the commanded route, matching both the position and yaw of the final waypoint.

Clients requiring high precision should check localization with `GetLocalizationState` RPC even after reaching the goal, as the robot will be close but not exactly on the goal.


## Autonomous navigation errors

The following error types can interrupt an autonomous route:

| Error code | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| STATUS_NO_ROUTE |	Indicates the client changed something that invalidated the route. |
| STATUS_NO_LOCALIZATION |	The robot is not localized to the map. |
| STATUS_NOT_LOCALIZED_TO_ROUTE |	Localized and not lost but not on the commanded route. |
| STATUS_COMMAND_OVERRIDDEN |	A new GraphNav command has overridden the command that the user is asking for feedback about. |
| STATUS_LOST |	Lost means the robot is no longer confident in its localization, and must be re-localized. |
| STATUS_STUCK |	Stuck means that the robot is still localized but is having trouble reaching the destination (usually because of an obstacle in the way). |
| STATUS_ROBOT_FROZEN <br> STATUS_ROBOT_FAULTED |	Indicates the robot fell or has a hardware problem. |
| STATUS_CONSTRAINT_FAULT |	Indicates the route is over-constrained. Choose a different route. |
| STATUS_LEASE_ERROR |	Indicates the lease given to GraphNav is no longer valid. |
| STATUS_COMMAND_TIMED_OUT |	Indicates a comms problem or the timeout deadline was reached. |
