# Navigation Services

GraphNav and Missions APIs allow client applications to localize the robot and define tasks for the robot to carry out during autonomous operation. While these services can be used independently, it's far more likely that your application will access these services in a coordinated fashion.

Review [the extensive catalog of code examples](../../../python/examples/README.md) in the Spot SDK to learn about accessing robot services with the Spot API.

The autonomous navigation and related services include:


*   GraphNavService
*   GraphNavRecordingService
*   MissionService
*   RemoteMissionService


 Refer to the [Python API Reference](../../../protos/bosdyn/api/README.md) for details about the APIs available for each service.
