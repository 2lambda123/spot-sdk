# Edit Autowalk

This example shows how to edit and replay an autowalk via the API. The replay_autowalk.py script allows the user to replay Autowalk missions using the autogenerated autowalk file. In addition, the user can drag and drop using the GUI to remove, duplicate, and reorder autowalk actions as desired.

This example assumes that Spot can see the fiducial from "Start" of your mission. To ensure the fiducial is in view, move Spot to a location where the initial fiducial is seen and verify that the fiducial has a purple overlay in the tablet camera view. You may then disconnect the tablet, engage the E-Stop on your current device, and replay the mission.

## Setup Dependencies

This example needs to be run with python3, and have the Spot SDK installed. See the requirements.txt file for a list of dependencies which can be installed with pip using the command:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before running the example, make sure to set the e-stop either using the tablet interface or computer. Look at the e-stop Python example for more information on how to set e-stop through the command line.

## Run the Example

You can use replay_autowalk.py to replay an Autowalk mission recorded using the tablet. Attach a USB cable to the tablet and copy the Autowalk mission directory to your PC. These missions are stored under Documents/bosdyn/autowalk on the tablet.

To edit and run an Autowalk mission using the default autogenerated mission file from the tablet:

```
python3 -m replay_autowalk ROBOT_IP MISSION_DIRECTORY
```

## Modifying the Autowalk

You can use replay_autowalk.py to replay an edited Autowalk mission recorded using the tablet. The editing interface will open, allowing you to drag and drop actions as desired to create a modified autowalk. Additionally, you can choose to run the Autowalk mission once, periodically, or continuously.
