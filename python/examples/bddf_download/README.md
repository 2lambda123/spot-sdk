# BDDF data download

This example shows how to download data from GRPC logs and/or the data-buffer service as bddf data.  The bddf format is a Boston Dynamics file format added to the SDK in 2.1.

## Setup Dependencies
These examples need to be run with python3, and have the Spot SDK installed. See the requirements.txt file for a list of dependencies which can be installed with pip.
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Examples

There are two scripts in this example.  The first is `bddf_download.py`, which downloads specified data from a robot and saves it as a bddf file.

Another example script is `bddf_read.py`, which extracts and prints protobuf messages stored in a bddf file.

To see the types of messages currently supported by the script, run
```
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py types
```

To list the available series of messages in a given bddf file, try
```
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py series {bddf-file}
```

To extract and print all operator comment messages in a bddf file, run
```
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py show {bddf-file} bosdyn.api.OperatorComment

```

To show `RobotId()` GRPC request messages stored in a bddf file, use
```
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py show-grpc {bddf-file} bosdyn.api.RobotIdRequest

```

To run the script `bddf_download.py` in the example command lines below, we will use the following variables (Bourne-shell syntax):
```
USERNAME=<username>
PASSWORD=<password>
ROBOT_IP=<ip-address>

DOWNLOAD_BDDF="python3 bddf_download.py --username ${USERNAME} --password ${PASSWORD} ${ROBOT_IP}"
```

### Specifying time spans

To get a list of formats supported for specifying time spans for data selection in `bddf_download.py`:
```
$ python3 bddf_download.py ${ROBOT_IP} --help-timespan
A timespan is {val} or {val}-{val} where:

{val} has one of these formats:
 - yyyymmdd_hhmmss  (e.g., 20200120_120000)
 - yyyymmdd         (e.g., 20200120)
 -  {n}d    {n} days ago
 -  {n}h    {n} hours ago
 -  {n}m    {n} minutes ago
 -  {n}s    {n} seconds ago
 - nnnnnnnnnn[.nn]       (e.g., 1581869515.256)  Seconds since epoch
 - nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn  Nanoseconds since epoch

For example:
  '5m'                    From 5 minutes ago until now.
  '20201107-20201108'     All of 2020/11/07.
```

### Basic data download

Download all data from the last 5 minutes (the default time span).  The data is saved to `./download.bddf` by default.
```
$ ${DOWNLOAD_BDDF}
```

### Operator comments

Download all operator comments sent to the data-buffer in last day and save to `comments.bddf`.
```
$ ${DOWNLOAD_BDDF} --timespan 1d --type bosdyn.api.OperatorComment -o comments.bddf
```

Print the comments:
```
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py show comments.bddf bosdyn.api.OperatorComment
```

### Events

Download all events from stored in the data-buffer on 2022/11/07, and save to `events.bddf`.
```
$ ${DOWNLOAD_BDDF} --timespan 20201107-20201108 --type bosdyn.api.Event -o events.bddf
```

Print the events.
```
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py show events.bddf bosdyn.api.Event
```

### GRPC requests/responses

Download robot-id GRPC requests/responses from 20 minutes ago to 10 minutes ago, and store them in file `robot-id.bddf`.
```
$ ${DOWNLOAD_BDDF} --timespan 20m-10m --service robot-id -o robot-id.bddf
```
 Print the request and response messages with
```
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py show-grpc robot-id.bddf bosdyn.api.RobotIdRequest
$ python3 ./bddf_read.py show-grpc robot-id.bddf bosdyn.api.RobotIdResponse
```
