# This script will:
# 0. Compile the Announce protobuf files
# 1. Register the payload (current system) with a robot
# 2. Register the Announce Service with a robot
# 3. Start an instance of Announce Service on the current system
# 4. Create a client and access the Announce Service through the robot

# Arguments:
# <robot_ip> <endpoint_ip> <endpoint_port> <payload_secret>
# robot_ip - IP address the robot can be accessed at from the current system
# endpoint_ip - IP address the current system can be accessed at from the robot
# endpoint_port - An open port on the current system for the service to communicate through
# payload_secret - A private 16 character string unique to this payload instance

# GUID should be a uniquely generated GUID.
