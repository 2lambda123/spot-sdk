# Perception & World Objects Examples

The following examples show how to use Spot's perception system, through image services and the world object service, for different applications, such as person detection or following a fiducial. See the [robot state services](../../../docs/concepts/robot_services.md) document for an overview of different perception services available through the SDK.
