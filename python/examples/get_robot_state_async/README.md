This example program demonstrates how to query the robot state service using wait-until-done, block-until-done, and callback-when-done. Please look at the code to see how each asynchronous query is accomplished.

## Setup Dependencies
This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Example
To run the example:
```
python3 get_robot_state_async.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
