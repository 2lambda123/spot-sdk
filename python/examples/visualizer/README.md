# Basic Streaming Visualizer for API Messages
This example program visualizes Spot's perception scene in a consistent coordinate frame. It demonstrates:
 * How to convert API objects, such as local grids and world objects, into the vision world frame.
 * Create a basic rendering of these objects using python VTK.
 * Stream the API messages to continuously update the visualization for a live-view.

## Setup Dependencies
This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Example
To run the example:

```
python3 -m basic_streaming_visualizer --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP [--local-grid {no-step,obstacle-distance,terrain}]
```
As well, the example program takes an optional command line argument of `--local-grid` to specify which local grid sources to be visualized. The argument must be one of `{terrain, obstacle-distance, no-step}`. By default, the program will visualize the terrain map, which shows the estimated heights of objects near Spot. To visualize more than one grid source at a time, you must repeat the command line argument for each grid source; for example, `--local-grid terrain --local-grid no-step`.

### Camera Controls

The controls to interact with the visualization screen while the example is running:

- R : reset the camera
- Left Mouse: rotate the camera
- Right Mouse: zoom in/out.
- Middle Mouse: pan the camera.

### Visualized Objects

The basic visualizer will display different objects in Spot's perception scene:
 * Spot is shown as a yellow, rectangular prism with position and orientation matching the robot state.
 * Fiducials are shown as red squares with the ID in text above the actual fiducial object.
 * Other world objects are visualized as small blue spheres at the location of the world object.
 * The local grid maps are visualized with color correlating to the intensity values of the grid, and the voxels correlating to the height of the terrain grid.
