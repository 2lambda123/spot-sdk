# Using the Robot Data Service

The data service tracks data logged to the robot via the API.  This includes:
- Text messages: Info/Warning/Error/Debug messages, typically logged by API services.
- Comments: Short messages, typically added by operators about the robot behavior.
- Events: Messages documenting a robot or client event, with a timestamp and possibly a duration.
- Message blobs: Arbitrary binary message blobs.

These, and other, messages are stored in data "pages" on the robot. A page is a discrete unit of storage tracked by the data service.

These example programs demonstrate how to query the robot data service for information about the robot's data pages and their contents.

## Setup Dependencies
This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Examples
Each example requires that you specify a username and password to authenticate with the robot.

### get_comments.py
Get operator comments logged via API.
```
python3 get_comments.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```

### get_events.py
Get events logged on the robot.
```
python3 get_events.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```

### get_index.py
Get lists of pages that contain blobs, text-message, events, or operator comments. COMMAND may be one of blob, text, event, or comment.
```
python3 get_index.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP COMMAND
```

### get_pages.py
Get a list of data pages currently on the robot.
```
python3 get_pages.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```

You may optionally specify a time range of pages to return.

For example:
```
python3 get_pages.py --username USER --password PASSWORD \
    --timespan 20201030-20201031 ROBOT_IP
```
See the description of time range specifications below.

### delete_pages.py
Delete data pages from the robot. Running this without a time range will delete all data pages on the robot.
```
python3 delete_pages.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
You may optionally specify a time range of pages to delete. For example:
```
python3 delete_pages.py --username USER --password PASSWORD \
    --timespan 20201031_115000-20201031_115950 --robot-time ROBOT_IP
```
You may specify only one start or only end time if preferred.


### Time ranges

Times in the command-line arguments are of the format _val_or _val_-_val_ where _val_ has one of these formats:
 - _yyyymmdd_hhmmss_  (e.g., `20200120_120000`)
 - _yyyymmdd_         (e.g., `20200120`)
 -  *n*d    _n_ days ago
 -  *n*h    _n_ hours ago
 -  *n*m    _n_ minutes ago
 -  *n*s    _n_ seconds ago
 - _nnnnnnnnnn[.nn]_       (e.g., `1581869515.256`)  Seconds since epoch
 - _nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn_  Nanoseconds since epoch

So:
- `5m` means from 5 minutes ago until now.
- `20201107-20201108` means all of 2020/11/07.

Adding `--robot-time` indicates that the specified time range is in the robot clock, so the specified value should _not_ be converted from client time to robot time.
