# Arm and Mobility

This example program shows sending a mobility and arm command at the same time. It demonstrates how to
initialize the SDK to talk to robot and how to command Spot to walk in a trajectory while simultaneously
moving the arm in a trajectory.

## Understanding Spot Programming
For your best learning experience, please use the [Quickstart Guide](../../../docs/python/quickstart.md)
found in the SDK's docs/python directory.  That will help you get your Python programming environment set up properly.  

## Common Problems
1. Remember, you will need to launch a software e-stop separately.  The E-Stop programming example is [here](../estop/README.md).
2. Make sure the Motor Enable button on the Spot rear panel is depressed.
3. Make sure Spot is sitting upright, with the battery compartment on the side closest the floor. 

## Setup Dependencies
This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the Example
Please be aware that this demo causes the robot to walk and move its arm. You have some
control over how much the robot moves (see _L_ROBOT_SQUARE and _L_ARM_CIRCLE) but regardless, the
robot should have at least (_L_ROBOT_SQUARE + 3) m of space in each direction when this demo is used.
By default, _L_ROBOT_SQUARE is 0.5, so an unmodified example should have ~3.5m space all around.

To run the example:
```
python3 arm_and_mobility_command.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
