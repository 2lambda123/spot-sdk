# Force Command

There are two force examples in this directory.
1. An example force trajectory by ramping up and down a vertical force over 10 seconds.
2. A more complex example demonstrating hybrid position-force mode and trajectories.

Both examples initialize the SDK to talk to robot and how to command Spot to stand before
executing the arm force control trajectories.

## Understanding Spot Programming
For your best learning experience, please use the [Quickstart Guide](../../../docs/python/quickstart.md)
found in the SDK's docs/python directory.  That will help you get your Python programming environment set up properly.  

## Common Problems
1. Remember, you will need to launch a software e-stop separately.  The E-Stop programming example is [here](../estop/README.md).
2. Make sure the Motor Enable button on the Spot rear panel is depressed.
3. Make sure Spot is sitting upright, with the battery compartment on the side closest the floor. 

## Setup Dependencies
This example requires the bosdyn API and client to be installed, and must be run using python3. Using pip, these dependencies can be installed using:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the Examples
To run the force example:
```
python3 force_trajectory.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
To run the hybrid trajectory example:
```
python3 force_wrench_control.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
