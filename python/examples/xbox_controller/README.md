#  Controlling the Robot with an Xbox Controller

Xbox Controller example allows users to control a Spot robot through an Xbox controller. The example was tested with an Xbox 360 wired controller. The button mapping is:

| Button Combination | Functionality            |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| A                  | Walk                     |
| B                  | Stand                    |
| X                  | Sit                      |
| Y                  | Stairs                   |
| LB + :             |                          |
| - D-pad up/down    | Walk height              |
| - D-pad left       | Battery-Change Pose      |
| - D-pad right      | Self right               |
| - Y                | Jog                      |
| - A                | Amble                    |
| - B                | Crawl                    |
| - X                | Hop                      |
|                    |                          |
| If Stand Mode      |                          |
| - Left Stick       |                          |
| -- X               | Rotate body in roll axis |  
| -- Y               | Control height           |
| - Right Stick      |                          |
| -- X               | Turn body in yaw axis    |
| -- Y               | Turn body in pitch axis  |
| Else               |                          |
| - Left Stick       | Move                     |
| - Right Stick      | Turn                     |
|                    |                          |
| LB + RB + B        | E-Stop                   |
| Start              | Motor power & Control    |
| Back               | Exit                     |


## User Guide
### Installation
For your best learning experience, please use the [Quickstart Guide](../../../docs/python/quickstart.md) 
found in the SDK's docs/python directory.  That will help you get your Python programming 
environment setup properly.

#### OS-Specific Dependencies
This example has external dependencies to communicate with an XBox controller, and those dependencies are OS-specific.

**Ubuntu**: On Ubuntu 18.04, the example uses the `xboxdrv` driver to communicate with the controller, so please install the driver by executing:

`sudo apt-get install xboxdrv`

The `xboxdrv` driver supports only Xbox360 controllers. Newer controllers are not supported.

**Windows**: On Windows, the example uses `XInput-Python` package, which is automatically installed with the pip command below. The `XInput` package officially supports Xbox360 controllers, but newer controllers also work with this example on Windows.

**MacOS**: This example is not supported on MacOS.

#### Installation Instructions
To install this example on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows, follow these instructions:
- Create virtual environment as described in this 
[Quickstart Guide virtualenv section](../../../docs/python/quickstart.md#manage-multiple-python-environments)
- Install dependencies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the example using instructions in the next section
- To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`

### Execution
This example follows the common pattern for expected arguments. It needs the common arguments used to configure the SDK and connect to a Spot:
- --username 
- --password
- hostname passed as the last argument

**1)** The example needs to be run as sudo. To run a python program as sudo within a virtual environment, you need to specify the python executable in the virtualenv folder:

`sudo venv/bin/python xbox_controller.py --user USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP`

**2)** After the controller is connected, the example prints a status window:
```
E-Stop	Control	Motors On	Mode
```

**3)** Next, press the key combination `Left Button + Right Button + B` to turn E-Stop on:
```
E-Stop	Control	Motors On	Mode
X
```

**4)** Next, press the `Guide` button to acquire a lease with this Spot:
```
E-Stop	Control	Motors On	Mode
X       X
```

**5)** Next, press the `Start` button to turn the motors on:
```
E-Stop	Control	Motors On	Mode
X       X       X
```

**6)** Spot is now ready to be controlled.

**7)** To E-Stop Spot at any time, press the E-Stop button combination (LB + RB + B)

**8)** To exit and power off Spot, press the `Back` button.
