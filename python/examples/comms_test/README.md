# Comms Testing
This example demonstrates how to use the SDK to perform comms testing.
This is meant to be run on a Spot CORE during an Autowalk mission.

## Setup Dependencies
This example needs to be run with python3, and have the Spot SDK installed. See the requirements.txt file for a list of dependencies which can be installed with pip using the command:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Example
To run the example:

On the server computer. Note that the server computer should not be associated with controls for the robot. The networks tests may behave in a way that limits controls communications to the robot.:
Setup:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iperf3
```

Running:
```
iperf3 -s
```

On the Spot CORE running the client:
Run:
```
python3 client.py --username USER --password PASSWORD 192.168.50.3 --protocol tcp --server-port 5201 --server-hostname 127.0.0.1
```

### Running with Docker
Alternatively, this example can be run with Docker. To do so, just build and run the image.
If you are building on a separate machine, you'll also need to import the image to the CORE.

Build the image:
```
sudo docker build -t comms_test .
```

Run the image:
```
sudo docker run comms_test --username USER --password PASSWORD 192.168.50.3 --protocol tcp --server-port 5201 --server-hostname 127.0.0.1
```
