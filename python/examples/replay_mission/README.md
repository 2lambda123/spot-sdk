# Replaying a Mission

This example shows how to replay a mission via the API. The replay_mission.py script allows the user to replay Autowalk missions using graph_nav, as well as simple missions that do not use graph_nav for navigation.

This example assumes that Spot can see the fiducial from "Start" of your mission. To ensure the fiducial is in view, move Spot to a location where the initial fiducial is seen and verify that the fiducial has a purple overlay in the tablet camera view. You may then disconnect the tablet, engage the E-Stop on your current device, and replay the mission.

## Setup Dependencies

This example needs to be run with python3, and have the Spot SDK installed. See the requirements.txt file for a list of dependencies which can be installed with pip using the command:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Example

To run an Autowalk mission using the default autogenerated mission file from the tablet:
```
python3 -m replay_mission --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP autowalk MAP_DIRECTORY
```

To run an Autowalk mission using a customized alternate mission file:
```
python3 -m replay_mission --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP autowalk MAP_DIRECTORY --autowalk_mission MISSION_FILE
```

To run a simple non-Autowalk mission that does not use graph_nav for navigation:
```
python3 -m replay_mission --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP simple MISSION_FILE
```
