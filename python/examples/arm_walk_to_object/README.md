# Walking to an Object

This example program shows using the ManipulationApiClient to automatically walk to an object,
usually in preparation for manipulating it. It demonstrates how to initialize the SDK to talk to
robot, take and present a picture from a user specified image source, allows the user to click the
image to designate the object to walk to.

## Setup Dependencies

See the requirements.txt file for a list of python dependencies which can be installed with pip
using the command:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Understanding Spot Programming
For your best learning experience, please use the [Quickstart Guide](../../../docs/python/quickstart.md)
found in the SDK's docs/python directory.  That will help you get your Python programming environment set up properly.

## Common Problems
1. Remember, you will need to launch a software e-stop separately.  The E-Stop programming example is [here](../estop/README.md).
2. Make sure the Motor Enable button on the Spot rear panel is depressed.
3. Make sure Spot is sitting upright, with the battery compartment on the side closest the floor.

## Run the Example
Please be aware that this demo causes the robot to walk and move its arm. Ensure there is enough
clearance around the robot to run this example.  There should be at least 2 meters of space around
the item to grasp.

To run the example:
```
python3 arm_walk_to_object.py --username USER --password PASSWORD ROBOT_IP
```
